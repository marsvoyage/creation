       <p>I'm not somebody who has a deep understanding of music - or any understanding at all. I can't read music or play any instrument. I only know how to create music based on what I like to hear.</p> 
       <p>With that being said, here are some music I've created to listen to during this quarantine time. I hope you enjoy it. Drop me a line if you have any instruction.</p>
